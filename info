Why js framework or libraries?
-Complexity of managing DOM manipulation and data updates manually.
-Well Defined application architecture
    --model view container/ model view view ModelView/modelview whatevere
    --binding of model adn view : controllers, view models
    --flux architecture/redux


Software library
-collection of implementation of behaviour with a well-defined interface by which
 the behavior is invoked
-reuse of behaviour
-Modulariy
eg jquery

Sotware framework
-Abstraction in whihc software provides generic functionality that can be selectively
changed by additional user-written code
-universal, reusable environment that provides particular
functionality as part of a larger software platform
Eg, Angular, Enber, Backbone

Library vs framework
library - your code is in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit.
framework - The framework is in charger and it calls into your code when it needs something app specific

framework
Inversion of control
Imperative approach - designer specifies how the work need to be done
Declarative approach - designer specifies what work needs to be done


React use declarative approach
Component based approach, we encapsulate behaviours into small units called component
Technology stack agnostic
React designed by Jordan Walke
